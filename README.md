# Exoplanet-Detection
This project is about Exoplanet Detection using lightkurve package with python.It covers lightcurves,target pixel files and periodograms,utilizing Kepler,K2 and TESS data of MAST.Following are the main exercises done during the project-
Conducted data analysis for Exoplanet Detection, utilizing lighkurve, astropy, numpy, and matplotlib libraries, along with Python programming language.
, Explored various target objects using data from Kepler, K2, and TESS missions obtained from the NASA MAST archive.
, Gained proficiency in working with Lightkurve objects, including Lightcurves, Target Pixel Files, and Periodograms.
, Applied folding, flattening, and binning techniques on lightcurves to enhance analysis and extract meaningful insights.
, Acquired knowledge of custom aperture photometry and instrumental noise to refine data processing.
, Successfully identified transiting exoplanet signals within lightcurves, uncovering intriguing findings.
, Visualized periodic signals using river plots, providing captivating representations of cyclic phenomena.
, Conducted asteroseismology to estimate key parameters such as mass, radius, and surface gravity of stars.
, Explored periodograms of delta-Scuti and solar-like stars, deepening understanding of their behaviors.
, Created a supernova lightcurve.
